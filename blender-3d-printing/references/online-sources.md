# Online 3D Print File Sources

Before creating or generating a 3D model from scratch, search existing repositories. Many models are already available, tested, and print-ready.

## Search Strategy

1. **Identify key search terms** from user's description
2. **Search free repositories first** (highest value)
3. **Search paid repositories if needed** (for premium/specific models)
4. **Evaluate results** for quality and suitability
5. **Present findings** categorized by free vs. paid
6. **Proceed based on user choice**

## How to Search Effectively

### 1. Prepare Search Terms
Extract key terms from user's request:
- Object type: "vase", "miniature", "bracket", "tool holder"
- Style: "modern", "gothic", "minimalist", "organic"
- Purpose: "decorative", "functional", "replacement part"
- Specific details: dimensions, features, compatibility

### 2. Systematic Search Process

**Step 1: Quick scan of free repositories**
Search top 3-4 free sites (MakerWorld, Printables, Thingiverse, MyMiniFactory) with primary keywords
- **Start with MakerWorld** if user has Bambu Lab printer

**Step 2: Evaluate top results**
For each promising result, check:
- Preview images and quality
- Print statistics (likes, makes, downloads)
- Comments for issues or tips
- License compatibility
- File format (STL, OBJ, 3MF preferred)
- Print-ready status (or needs work)

**Step 3: If free results insufficient, check paid sites**
Search 2-3 paid repositories if:
- Free options are low quality
- Specific design requirements
- User willing to pay for quality

**Step 4: Present findings**

## Quality Evaluation Criteria

### Indicators of Quality

**Good signs:**
- ✅ High "makes" or "downloads" count
- ✅ Positive comments with photos
- ✅ Recent upload (updated for modern printers)
- ✅ Multiple images from different angles
- ✅ Designer provides print settings
- ✅ Active designer with multiple models
- ✅ Test-printed badge (MyMiniFactory)

**Warning signs:**
- ⚠️ No comments or very few downloads
- ⚠️ Comments mention print failures
- ⚠️ Only render images, no actual prints
- ⚠️ Incomplete or missing parts
- ⚠️ Requires supports but none provided
- ⚠️ Scale issues mentioned

### Print-Ready Assessment

**Print-ready models:**
- Manifold geometry (watertight)
